# New Liberals user Pinger

This is a Reddit bot, api, and website that allows users to "ping" groups on the subreddit [/r/newliberals](https://reddit.com/r/newliberals). Users may subscribe to a group such as KITTY, ping that group by writing a comment containing "!ping KITTY", and then everyone else who has subscribed to that group will receive a message with a link to that comment - which in this case would likely include a cat photo. Many groups exist for a variety of topics. Broadly, the purpose of this software is to allow users to more easily find content relevant to their interests that would otherwise be hidden among other submissions and comments

This is a fork of [the original User Pinger 2](https://github.com/neoliberal/user_pinger_2) to work with r/newliberals.
